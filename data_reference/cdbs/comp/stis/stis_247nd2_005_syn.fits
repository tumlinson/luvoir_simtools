Smith  HISTORY   --------------------------------------------------------------        HISTORY   F28X50OII Update of December 1998                                     HISTORY   This revision adds the out-of-nominal-band throughput                 HISTORY   (red leak) and 0-valued endpoints.  The red leak was first            HISTORY   added to the synphot version of this table in March/April 1997.       HISTORY   That synphot table reported the red leak measurement as               HISTORY   coming from a witness sample scanned by the manufacturer.             HISTORY   The May, 1997, IDT report of the analysis of the red leak             HISTORY   notes that the spike at 6000 angstroms has negligible                 HISTORY   transmission. 'It can not be seen in the measured trans-              HISTORY   missions sent by Ball; we found it using prelaunch images.            HISTORY   It was barely seen in those spectra.'

The 0.2X0.05ND and 0.3X0.05ND apertures    HISTORY   also have revised transmissions, as well as the 31X0.05NDA-C and      HISTORY   F25NDQ1-4 filters.                                                    HISTORY   The F28X50OIII filter has a sharp decrease in peak throughput (a      HISTORY   factor of 2), although the total throughput is unchanged.  This       HISTORY   is because the new transmissions (based on in-orbit data) include     HISTORY   the star's PSF, while the previous (ground-based) measurement did not;HISTORY   the PSF broadens the transmission.                                    COMMENT   Jan. 99 Updated by R. Bohlin, C. Leitherer, and P. Plait              HISTORY   new_apt.fits renamed to j2b1313jo_apt.fits on Feb 11 1999             HISTORY   The Jan 99 update to this file for the F28X50OIII filter used         HISTORY   in-flight data for the transmission which had the PSF convolved with  HISTORY   the actual filter throughput.  The PSF should be removed via          HISTORY   deconvolution.  The data are unsuitable quality for this, however.    HISTORY   A PSF was constructed from observations of HR7615, observation set    HISTORY   O49Q02010, proposal ID 7642, by block averaging 7 rows centered on    HISTORY   the stellar image.  This was convolved with the vendor's transmission HISTORY   curve (as given in the Dec 1998 file, oref$icb12027o_apt.fits).       HISTORY   Comparison of this to the in-flight curve reveals a nearly identical  HISTORY   shape (peak, width, area the same) with a 0.28 pixel offset in        HISTORY   wavelength.  The offset is plausibly attributable to target acq error.HISTORY   The conclusion is that the vendor curve is an accurate representation HISTORY   of the in-flight filter throughput.  Therefore, the throughput as     HISTORY   given in the December 1998 delivery was used to replace the values    HISTORY   in the January 1999 version of this file, with one minor change:      HISTORY   as in the January 1999 version, the red-leak section was extrapolated HISTORY   to 11999 A, and then zeroed out at 12000 A.
